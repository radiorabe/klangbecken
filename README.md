_Klangbecken_ is the minimalistic endless music player for Radio Bern RaBe based on [liquidsoap](https://www.liquidsoap.info).

It supports configurable and editable playlists, jingle insertion, metadata publishing and more.

It is [designed](doc/design.md) for stand-alone operation, robustness and good maintainability. All data is stored in common files in a single [data directory](doc/data-dir.md).

This repository contains three components of the RaBe Klangbecken:
* The [API](doc/api.md)
* The [command line interface](doc/cli.md)
* The [liquidsoap play-out script](klangbecken.liq)

Two additional components are in their own repository:
* The listener for the current "on air" status, the [virtual SÃ¤mubox](https://github.com/radiorabe/virtual-saemubox).
* The [web-based UI](https://github.com/radiorabe/klangbecken-ui) for playlist editing.

How they interact can be seen in the [system overview diagram](doc/system-overview.png):

## Local Setup

Fork this repository and clone it from there:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/klangbecken.git
cd klangbecken
```

Create a virtual environment (also see [additional tools](doc/additional-tools.md)):
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Install dependencies
Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Install `ffmpeg` with your system's package manager. E.g.:
```bash
yum install ffmpeg
```
Install Liquidsoap (_Note:_ On CentOS 7 you can also use our prebuilt [package](https://github.com/radiorabe/centos-rpm-liquidsoap)):
```bash
yum install opam
opam init
# we need liquidsoap 1.3.7 which does not run after OCaml 4.07.0
opam switch create klangbecken 4.07.0
opam depext alsa mad lame vorbis taglib liquidsoap.1.3.7
opam install alsa mad lame vorbis taglib liquidsoap.1.3.7
eval $(opam env)
```

Install the client UI:
```bash
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/radiorabe/klangbecken-ui
cd klangbecken-ui
npm install
```

### Run the programs

Initialize the data directory:
```bash
python -m klangbecken init
```

Run the development back-end server (API and data directory):
```bash
python -m klangbecken serve
```

Run the client development server (user interface):
```bash
cd ../klangbecken-ui
npm run serve
```

Browse to http://localhost:8080 and start uploading audio files.

Run the liquidsoap audio player:
```bash
eval $(opam env)
liquidsoap klangbecken.liq
```

Manually set the on-air status of the player using `netcat`:
```bash
echo "klangbecken.on_air True" | nc -U -w 1 klangbecken.sock
```


## Development

For contributing to this project, fork this repository, and clone your local working copy from your personal fork. Push commits to your repository to create pull requests with your changes.

### Python Package

The Python code is tested with a test suite and follows the flake8 coding guidelines.

Before submitting your code you might want to make sure that ...

1. ... you have installed the test dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-test.txt
   ```

2. ... the test suite runs without failure
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover
   ```
3. ... all your code is covered by (hopefully) meaningful unit tests
   ```bash
   coverage run -m unittest discover
   coverage report
   ```
4. ... your code follows the coding style guidelines
   ```bash
   flake8
   ```

#### Recommended Tools _(optional)_

We recommend the use of `tox`, `black` and `isort` for development.
```bash
pip install tox black isort
```
##### tox
Instead of running all the above commands manually, `tox` lets you run them all at once for all installed Python versions. Make sure to have at least the Python version installed, that is used in production (currently Python 3.9). `tox` is also what we use in continuos integration, so using it locally helps you to make your code pass it. To call it simply type:
```bash
tox
```

##### black
Manually fixing coding style mistakes is a pain. `black` formats your code automatically.
```bash
black .
```

##### isort
Finally, `isort` helps to consistently organize package imports.
```bash
isort .
```

All development tools are preconfigured in [`setup.cfg`](setup.cfg). For additional tools and tips & tricks and  see [additional tools](doc/additional-tools.md).

### Liquidsoap Script

Liquidsoap lets you syntax check and type check your script:
```bash
liquidsoap --check klangbecken.liq
```

#### Simulation

Apart from type checking, the inherent nature of the liquidsoap language generating a live audio stream makes it difficult to test the code with unit tests. Observing the behavior of the player script and the effects of changes in real-time take lot of time, usually weeks or even months. [Accelerated simulation runs](doc/simulation.md) help to observe the long-time player behavior in a reasonable amount of time.

## Deployment

Your code has passed continuous integration, and your pull request has been accepted. Now you want to deploy your (or somebody else's) code to production. First, some preparations are necessary, but then the deployment script `deploy.sh` automates most of the work deploying the code.

_Preparations before deploying for the first time:_
* Make sure that you have access to the production server (e.g. SSH publik key authentication).
* Configure a remote `prod` pointing at the repository on the production system:
  ```bash
  git add remote prod root@YOUR_PRODUCTION_VM_NAME:klangbecken.git
  ```
* _Optional:_ Install the Apache development libraries locally. E.g.:
  ```bash
  yum install httpd-devel
  ```
* Configure a remote repository `upstream` pointing at the upstream repository:
  ```bash
  git remote add upstream git@github.com:radiorabe/klangbecken-ui.git
  ```
* Configure git to automatically fetch tags from `upstream`:
  ```bash
  git config remote.upstream.tagOpt --tags
  ```


_Preparation before deploying_:
* When deploying both, the [front-end](https://github.com/radiorabe/klangbecken-ui) and the back-end app, deploy the front-end _first_.
* Check again that the code you want to deploy passed continuous integration.
* Make sure that your working directory is clean, and that you are on the master branch:
  ```bash
  git stash
  git checkout master
  ```
* Bring your code in sync with the latest version from `upstream`:
  ```bash
  git fetch upstream
  git rebase upstream/master
  ```
* Verify that you are indeed in sync with `upstream`:
  ```bash
  git show --no-patch
  ```

_Run the script:_
```bash
./deploy.sh [--no-mod-wsgi]
```
It performs the following steps:
- Increment and commit a new version number.
- Download all run-time dependencies.
- Optionally download `mod_wsgi` (Requires `httpd-devel` libraries to be installed locally. Use `--no-mod-wsgi` to skip this step).
- Copy the dependencies to production.
- Push your code to production.
- Install all dependencies in production.
- Install the Python package (API and CLI) in production.
- Reload the web server to load the new API code.
- Copy the liquidsoap script to it's destination.
- If everything was successful, tag the current commit with the new version number, and push it to the `upstream` repository.

_Finalize deployment:_
- If the liquidsoap script `klangbecken.liq` changed, restart the liquidsoap player during an "off air" moment:
  ```bash
  systemctl restart liquidsoap@klangbecken
  ```

For detailed information on how to setup a productive server see [Deployment](doc/deployment.md).
